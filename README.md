# Cryptonite-Taskphase

A repository to store and track my progress through the various task phases of **Cryptonite**, the cybersecurity related student project of the Manipal Institute of Technology.

- **Phase 1:** Consisted of solving the first 22 levels of the [bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) challenge, an entry-level CTF primarily serving as an introduction to the Linux shell.
- **Phase 2:** Involved solving a list of challenges on [picoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/practice), an intermediate cybersecurity challenge series.
